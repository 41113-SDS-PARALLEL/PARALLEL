# PARALLEL

## Project Overview

PARALLEL is a software development project created as part of the Software Development Studio course. The project is a calendar application with a few additional features that are ont typically found in popular calendar applications.

## Features

In addition to typical calendar functionality, PARALLEL has the following features:

- [Timeblocking]: Automatic allocation of time to ongoing tasks with or without deadlines.
- [Split Streams]: Splitting of your week into different 'streams', such as work, school and personal streams.
- [Task Customisation]: Customisation of tasks to be ongoing, have a deadline, or have a set time to complete.

   git clone https://github.com/41113-SDS-PARALLEL/PARALLEL.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```

   ```
3. (optional) If you want the latest experimental features, switch to the `dev` branch:

4. Install dependencies:
